# Mongolian Datasets

This repository contains Mongolian datasets in the public domain. 

Special thanks to Greg Eck for releasing his large dataset (18000+ entries) to the public domain. I hope many more individuals, companies, and organizations will follow his example. By working together, we can make it easier for developers to build quality tools like spell checkers, converters, and IMEs.

If you would like to add another dataset to this repository or make improvements, please submit a pull request. However, the only contributions that will be accepted are those that are already in the public domain or that you own and are willing to release to the public domain.
