# Mongolian Datasets

This repository contains Mongolian datasets in the public domain. 

Special thanks to all those who contribute their time and effort to providing quality data to the public. By working together, we can make it easier for developers to build tools like spell checkers, converters, and IMEs.

If you would like to add another dataset to this repository or make improvements, please submit a pull request. However, the only contributions that will be accepted are those that are already in the public domain or that you own and are willing to release to the public domain.
